# Autome

Automata simulation with Python.

![Autome logo](./docs/logo.png)

## Introduction

Autome can help you to simulate some kinds of computational models, i'm still thinking of a good way to represent configurations and inputs, but until then you can play directly with the code if you want.

## Roadmap

- [X] Multitape deterministic Turing-Machines
- [ ] Multitape non-deterministic Turing-Machines
- [ ] Configurable and easy to use inputs
- [ ] GUI
- [ ] Other automatas?

## Contributing

Feel free to build anything that's on the roadmap, or even give new ideas, i will be happy to help you to write features and submit PR's.
